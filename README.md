# Crop-Recommendation-Sustainable-Agriculture-
Agriculture plays a crucial role in the economy and food security of many countries. With increasing population and changing climate conditions, farmers face challenges in choosing the most suitable crops for their soil and environment. A Crop Recommendation System is designed to help farmers make informed decisions by predicting the best crop to cultivate based on various environmental and soil parameters.

This project leverages Machine Learning techniques to analyze input features such as soil nutrients (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium), temperature, humidity, pH level, and rainfall. By training on historical crop data, the system can recommend the most suitable crop for optimal yield, reducing risk and improving productivity.

Key advantages of such a system include:

Data-driven decision-making: Farmers get scientifically backed crop suggestions.

Time and cost efficiency: Reduces trial-and-error cultivation.

Sustainability: Helps in choosing crops suitable for the current climate and soil conditions.

The project typically involves data preprocessing, feature scaling, model training, and label encoding/decoding to provide accurate crop recommendations. The final system can be deployed as a web application or desktop tool, allowing farmers to input their field parameters and receive instant crop suggestions.

Week 1:
In week 1 i collected the dataset which is suitable and needed for my project.
After picking the dataset i cleaned and preprocessed the data which i want to train the model

Week 2:
Training and Testing the model based on the preprocessed data
Predicted the accuray of each model.
selected which machine learning model i am going to use for the predection.
crop prediction is done
